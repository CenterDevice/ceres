.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
ceres is a CLI tool for common SRE and ops tasks for CenterDevice.
.PP
ceres comes with different modules.
It supports human readable as well as JSON output for post\-processing
with other tools like \f[C]jq\f[].
.PP
For ceres to work properly \-\- actually to work at all \-\- a
configuration file is required that specifies the stage and its
endpoints as well as required credentials for CenterDevice environments.
See \f[I]ceres.conf\f[] for details.

.SH MODULES
.PP
Currently, there is only one module called \f[I]instances\f[].
.SS INSTANCES
.PP
The \f[I]instances\f[] modules interacts with instances in the
environment selected by the profile to use.
Currently the only command supported is \f[I]list\f[].
.SS instances list
.PP
\f[I]instances list\f[] shows all currently active instances.
Instances can be filtered and the output can be controlled to allow for
human readable format or JSON format for post\-processing.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-filter \f[I]filter\f[]
Filters instances by description fields.
The filter syntax is \f[I]<description field>=<reg ex>\f[].
Multiple filters can be used and have to be separated by \[aq],\[aq].
Each description field will be matched against the regular expression.
Only instances matching all description field will be selected.
.RS
.RE
.PP
The special description field \f[I]Tags\f[] supports a specialized
syntax which is \f[I]Tags=<tag name>[=<reg ex>]\f[].
Multiple tags can be used and have to be separated by \[aq]:\[aq].
If a tag is specified without a regular expressions, only instances
bearing that tag will be selected.
If a tag is specified with a regular expression, only instances bearing
that tag with a matching value will be selected.
Instances have to match all tags to be selected.
.PP
For example, the filter
\[aq]InstanceId=i\-.*,Tags=Name:AnsibleHostGroup=batch_.*,State=stopped\[aq]
will only selected instances with an instance id beginning in
\[aq]i\-\[aq], the tag \[aq]Name\[aq] set, the tag
\[aq]AnsibleHostGroup\[aq] with a value starting in \[aq]batch_\[aq] and
in the state \[aq]stopped\[aq] will be selected.
.PP
The available description field to filter against are:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
BlockDeviceMappings,\ Hypervisor,\ IamInstanceProfile,\ ImageId,\ InstanceId,\ InstanceType,\ LaunchTime,\ Monitoring,\ Placement,\ PrivateDnsName,\ PrivateIpAddress,\ PublicDnsName,\ PublicIpAddress,\ RootDeviceName,\ RootDeviceType,\ SecurityGroups,\ State,\ StateReason,\ Tags(_),\ VirtualizationType,\ VpcId
\f[]
.fi
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-output \f[I]output\f[]
Selects output format.
The default is \f[I]human\f[].
Available options are \f[I]human\f[] and \f[I]json\f[].
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-output\-options \f[I]output\-options\f[]
Selects the instance description fields for human output.
The default is
\[aq]InstanceId,InstanceType,State,PrivateIpAddress,PublicIpAddress,LaunchTime\[aq].
The special description field \f[I]Tags\f[] may take a list of concrete
tags to show.
The corresponding syntax is similar to the tags filter and is
\f[I]Tags[=<tag name>]\f[].
Multiple tags can be used have to separated by \[aq]:\[aq].
.RS
.RE
.PP
For example, the output options
\[aq]InstanceId,Tags=Name:AnsibleHostGroup\[aq] outputs the instance id
and the tags \[aq]Name\[aq] and AnsibleHostGroup\[aq] for all selected
instances.
.PP
The available options are:
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
BlockDeviceMappings,\ Hypervisor,\ IamInstanceProfile,\ ImageId,\ InstanceId,\ InstanceType,\ LaunchTime,\ Monitoring,\ Placement,\ PrivateDnsName,\ PrivateIpAddress,\ PublicDnsName,\ PublicIpAddress,\ RootDeviceName,\ RootDeviceType,\ SecurityGroups,\ State,\ StateReason,\ Tags(_),\ VirtualizationType,\ VpcId
\f[]
.fi
.SS instances terminate \f[I]INSTANCE_ID ...\f[]
.PP
\f[I]instances terminate\f[] terminates instances by instance id and
outputs the corresponding state changes.
A prompt will ask for confirmation before any termination is executed.
The output can be controlled to allow for human readable format or JSON
format for post\-processing.
.TP
.B \f[I]INSTANCE_ID ...\f[]
Sets the instance id to terminate.
Multiple instance ids may be set.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-dry
Activates dry run.
Permissions and instance ids will be checked by AWS, but no instance
will be terminated.
.RS
.RE
.TP
.B \-o, \-\-output \f[I]output\f[]
Selects output format.
The default is \f[I]human\f[].
