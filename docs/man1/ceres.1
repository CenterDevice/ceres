.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
ceres is a CLI tool for common SRE and ops tasks for CenterDevice.
.PP
ceres comes with different modules.
It supports human readable as well as JSON output for post-processing
with other tools like \f[C]jq\f[R].
.PP
For ceres to work properly \[en] actually to work at all \[en] a
configuration file is required that specifies the stage and its
endpoints as well as required credentials for CenterDevice environments.
See \f[I]ceres.conf\f[R] for details.
